## About
This the repository of Team KnowMore (Team #6) at the SPARC Codeathon 2021. Click [here](https://commonfund.nih.gov/sparc) to find out more about the NIH SPARC Program. Click [here](https://sparc.science/help/2021-sparc-fair-codeathon) to find out more about the SPARC Codeathon 2021.

## The Problem
All the datasets generated by SPARC funded projects are curated and shared according to strict guidelines that ensure these datasets are [Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR)](). Specifically, the datasets are organized and annotated following the [SPARC Data Structure]() and then shared publicly on the SPARC Data Portal. The SPARC program thus provides a wealth of openly available and well curated datasets. This is great! But...

While it is very easy to look at the findings of each individual datasets on the portal, there is currently **no easy way to make preliminary discoveries or analysis across multiple datasets of choice**. Typically, a researcher wanting to find relations across datasets would have to do so manually, i.e., read the description of each datasets, go through their protocols, browse files that are accessible from the browser, etc. If they find that the datasets could have some interesting relations that is worth investigating further, they will then have to download each dataset (payment may be required according to AWS pricing) before analyzing them further manually. This is a tedious process that needs to be improved critically in order to 1) Enable rapid discoveries and scientific progress from SPARC datasets, 2) Encourage more researchers to use the SPARC Data Portal.


## Our Solution - KnowMore
To address this problem, we have developed a feature called KnowMore for the SPARC Data Portal. KnowMore is an automated knowledge discovery tools that allows users of the portal to visualize, in just a few click, potential relations and/or correlation between data across multiple datasets. This simple process is illustrated in the figure below.

The output consists of multiple items generated from a joint analysis of all the datasets: 
1. Common keywords describing jointly the dataset
2. An automated summary of the combined datasets
3. A knowledge graph
4. Clustering of similar images (if images are included in the datasets)
5. Correlation between measured quantities (if tabular data is included in the datasets). 
A screenshot of a sample output is presented in the figure below. This output allows provides a foundation to the user for rapidly identifying potential relations or previously unknown correlation between the data and proceed accordingly in their investigation.

Under the hood, KnowMore uses several Machine Learning and Data Science workflows to output the above-mentioned elements:
*	Natural Language Processing (items #1 to 3)
*	Image classification (item #4)
*	Correlation matrix (item #5)
